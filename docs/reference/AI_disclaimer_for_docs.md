# Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Percona Everest Documentation


The writers of this documentation use generative AI in content creation, language refinement, and formatting optimization, especially in the new additions to the documentation.

We take full responsibility for reviewing and refining all content to ensure it is accurate, clear, and consistent, regardless of how it was created. Our committed team carefully reviews every piece to maintain Percona's high standards.
