# Frequently asked questions

This section outlines the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Percona Everest.


???+ Question

    What is a `DatabaseEngine`, and can you provide an example of **Database Engine Operations**? Does it manage database operators, such as upgrading the operator, or is it related to Percona Everest resources?

    The `DatabaseEngine` is a resource that contains compatible PG/PXC/MongoDB versions for the current Everest version. This information can be retrieved and updated.

    Refer to our API documentation at https://percona-everest.readme.io/reference/getkubernetesclusterresources for in-depth information.

**Q: Everest API**

- Do we have logs of the API calls made? This would help us validate whether an API call was executed for a user operation and if it encountered any errors. This is important for troubleshooting issues where an operation is completed, but the corresponding Everest operator resource hasnâ€™t been created for some reason. 

    Yes, the Everest backend has logs. It runs as a `percona-everest` deployment within the `everest-system `namespace. 


- If we have these logs, where are they stored?

    You can retrieve logs from the pods associated with this deployment.


**Q: Frontend:** Do we have any logs for frontend actions, like nginx logs, to troubleshoot issues between the frontend and the Percona Everest API?

The logs will be accessible in the console of the web browser.

**Q: Everest operator image:** Are there any additional resources that are not included in the image? For instance, is there a resource that handles the API calls and interacts with individual resources? Should we check its logs for troubleshooting when issues arise? Alternatively, does the Everest API communicate directly with the Everest operator resources? In that case, should we match the "Percona operator" issue with the corresponding Everest resource and address the problem from there?


All communication with Everest resources begins with the API.

The API is responsible for updating Everest resources, while the Everest operator continues to create resources for the corresponding database operators. When debugging, start with the API, then proceed to the Everest operator, and finally examine the individual database operators.


**Q:** PMM appears to be absent in this context. While `MonitorConfig` is present, does this resource interact directly with each `ppm-agent` container on the database pods, deploy new PMM Servers, and modify their configuration?


When communicating with PMM, we generate an API key to facilitate data transmission. This API key allows us to configure monitoring endpoints for individual database operators, enabling them to send data to PMM.

!!! note
    PMM is an external service we support and does not necessarily fit into our architecture.
