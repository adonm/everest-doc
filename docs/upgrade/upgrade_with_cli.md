# Upgrade Percona Everest using everestctl

Percona Everest regularly releases updates that contain bug fixes, security improvements, and other enhancements to improve the overall performance of your database.


## Before you upgrade

### Percona Everest and everestctl version compatibility

- For most cases, we recommend installing the latest version of `everestctl` before attempting an upgrade.
- If you're working with older versions, you must use `everestctl` versions 1.2 and 1.3 for Percona Everest 1.2 and 1.3, respectively. However, starting with Percona Everest 1.4, use `everestctl` version 1.4 or higher.

### Upgrade constraints

You can **only upgrade one minor version** at a time. For instance, you can upgrade from version 1.4.0 to version 1.5.0 but you cannot directly upgrade from version 1.4.0 to version 1.6.0.  


## Upgrade instructions

=== "Version 1.7.0"
    ### Upgrade to Percona Everest 1.7.0

    Before you upgrade to Percona Everest 1.7.0, run the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl label namespaces everest-system app.kubernetes.io/managed-by-
    ```

    !!! note
        This command removes the label `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` from the `everest-system` namespace. This label was used in earlier versions of Percona Everest and may interfere with the working of `everestctl` during an upgrade.

    Depending on the version of Percona Everest originally installed, you may see different outputs:

    ??? example "Percona Everest initially installed versions 1.4.0 and onwards"
        You will get the following output:

        ```sh
        label "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" not found.
        namespace/everest-system not labeled
        ```

    ??? example "Percona Everest initially installed versions prior to 1.4.0"
        You will get the following output:

        ```sh
        namespace/everest-system unlabeled
        ```

    To upgrade Percona Everest, run the following command:

    ```sh
    everestctl upgrade
    ```

    You can always check the available options by running:

    ```sh
    everestctl upgrade --help
    ```

=== "Version 1.3.0 and onwards"
    ### Upgrade to Percona Everest 1.3.0+

    To upgrade Percona Everest, run the following command:

    ```sh
    everestctl upgrade
    ```

    ??? example "Example: Upgrade from version 1.4.0 to 1.5.0"

        **Install Percona Everest version 1.4.0**

        ```sh
        everestctl install --version 1.4.0

        ```


=== "Version 1.2.0"
    ### Upgrade to Percona Everest 1.2.0

    To upgrade Percona Everest, run the following command:

    ```sh
    everestctl upgrade
    ```

    When upgrading to 1.2.0 using the CLI command `everestctl upgrade`, all your existing backup storages and monitoring instances will be automatically migrated to the namespaces specified in their `.spec.allowedNamespaces` fields.

    Following the upgrade, your databases should not experience any downtime. Your backup, restore, and monitoring functionalities should continue to operate normally. 

    In the unlikely event that your upgrade fails, and you need to manually migrate these resources, follow the steps in [how to resolve upgrade failures in Percona Everest 1.2.0](#how-to-address-a-failed-upgrade) section.

    ??? info "Resolving upgrade failures due to the breaking API changes"
        Percona Everest 1.2.0 includes some [breaking API changes](../api_rbac.md#navigating-the-breaking-api-changes-for-rbac). While all your resources will be migrated automatically, in the unlikely event that your upgrade fails and you need to manually migrate these resources, follow the steps below:
        {.power-number}

        1. List the existing backup-storages:

            ```
            kubectl get backupstorages -n everest-system -oyaml > new-backupstorages.yaml
            ```

        2. Check whether the backup storage has been retrieved.

            ```sh
            cat new-backupstorages.yaml

            apiVersion: everest.percona.com/v1alpha1
            kind: BackupStorage
            metadata:
            name: s3
            namespace: everest-system
            spec:
            allowedNamespaces:
            - my-cool-namespace
            - another-cool-namespace
            bucket: my-cool-bucket
            credentialsSecretName: s3
            description: s3
            endpointURL: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
            forcePathStyle: false
            region: us-west-2
            type: s3
            verifyTLS: true
            ```

            !!! note
                You may see more than one object, depending on the number of objects created.


        3. Edit `new-backupstorages.yaml` as follows:

            1. For each `BackupStorage` retrieved, create a copy in each namespace specified under `.spec.allowedNamespaces`.

            2. Remove (or unset) `.spec.allowedNamespaces` in each copy of the `BackupStorages` object.
                
            3. Ensure that `.metadata` contains only `name` and `namespace`.

            ??? example "Example"
                ```sh
                apiVersion: everest.percona.com/v1alpha1
                kind: BackupStorage
                metadata:
                name: s3
                namespace: my-cool-namespace
                spec:
                allowedNamespaces: []
                bucket: my-cool-bucket
                credentialsSecretName: s3
                description: s3
                endpointURL: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
                forcePathStyle: false
                region: us-west-2
                type: s3
                verifyTLS: true
                ---
                apiVersion: everest.percona.com/v1alpha1
                kind: BackupStorage
                metadata:
                name: s3
                namespace: another-cool-namespace
                spec:
                allowedNamespaces: []
                bucket: my-cool-bucket
                credentialsSecretName: s3
                description: s3
                endpointURL: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
                forcePathStyle: false
                region: us-west-2
                type: s3
                verifyTLS: true
                ```

        4. Create your new backup storages:

                kubectl apply -f new-backupstorages.yaml

            A similar set of steps can also be followed for monitoring configs as well:

                kubectl get monitoringconfigs -n everest-monitoring > new-monitoringconfigs.yaml   

=== "Versions prior to 1.2.0"
    ### Upgrade to versions older than 1.2.0

    !!! note
        It is recommended that you create backups of your databases prior to upgrading Percona Everest.

    During the upgrade of Percona Everest, only Percona Everest and Everest operator are upgraded, whereas the database operators, database clusters and backups remain unchanged.
    {.power-number}

    1. If you are using `everestctl` v1.1.0 or newer to upgrade from a version prior to v1.0.0, you need to execute the following command:

        ```sh
        kubectl get deployments everest-operator-controller-manager -n everest-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=="manager")].env[?(@.name=="DB_NAMESPACES")].value}' | tr ',' '\n' | xargs -I {} kubectl label namespaces {} app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=everest
        ```

    2. To upgrade Percona Everest, use the following command:

        ```sh
        everestctl upgrade
        ```

        ??? example "Expected output"
            ```

## How to address a failed upgrade

If the upgrade fails, you can attempt it again. If the issue persists, [create a GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository).


## After your upgrade is complete

After upgrading your Percona Everest version, follow the instructions in step 3 and step 4 of the [installation](../install/installEverest.md) section to reset the admin password and expose the Percona Everest service.
