# Role Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) is widely used to manage access to resources within an organization. It establishes a framework that defines access permissions and privileges according to individual users' roles. With RBAC, only authorized individuals can access specific information or perform certain actions based on their assigned roles. This method improves security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and helps manage permissions more efficiently across the organization.
