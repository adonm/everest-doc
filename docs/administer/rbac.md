# Role Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access to resources within Percona Everest. It establishes a framework that defines access permissions and privileges according to individual users' roles. With RBAC, only authorized individuals can access specific information or perform certain actions based on their assigned roles. This method improves security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and helps manage permissions more efficiently across Percona Everest.


## Default role

In Percona Everest, the only predefined default role is **admin**. The **admin** user is a superuser and it has unrestricted access to Percona Everest. However, the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration can define and allocate specific roles based on individual requirements and access privileges.

- `role:admin`Â - unrestricted access to all resources

This default built-in role definition can be seen in [policy.csv](https://github.com/percona/everest/blob/main/deploy/quickstart-k8s.yaml#L91)



## Policy definition in RBAC

RBAC policies are the rules and guidelines that define how roles, permissions, and users are managed within RBAC. These policies ensure that users have appropriate access to resources based on their roles within Percona Everest.


The policy definiiton in Percona Everest is:


```sh
    p, adminrole:role, <resource>, <action>, <namespace>/<objectname>`
```
    
Where:

 adminrole:role: refers to the subject. It can also be name of the user.

 resource: could be `namespaces, database engines,` etc.

 action: such `read, create, update, delete`

namespace>/objectname: `*` refers to the object (it means **all**). Alternatively it can be of the format `<namespace>/<objectname>`.


### Super Admin policy

Check out the policy for a `Super Admin` role:

```sh
{* Super Admin role definition *}
    p, adminrole:role, namespaces, read, *
    p, adminrole:role, database-engines, *, */*
    p, adminrole:role, database-clusters, *, */*
    p, adminrole:role, database-clusters-credentials, read, */*
    p, adminrole:role, backup-storages, *, */*
    p, adminrole:role, monitoring-instances, *, */*
```

### Readonly policy

Check out the policy for a `readonly` role:

```sh
{* Read Only role definition *}
    p, readonly:role, namespaces, read, *
    p, readonly:role, database-engines, read, */*
    p, readonly:role, database-clusters, read, */*
    p, readonly:role, backup-storages, read, */*
    p, readonly:role, monitoring-instances, read, */*
```

### Examples

Let's set up an Admin Group role for just one namespace called **the-dark-side**.

```sh
 {* EXAMPLE: Admin Group role definition for only one namespace **the-dark-side**}
 p, admin-darkside:role, namespaces, read, the-dark-side
 p, admin-darkside:role, database-engines, *, the-dark-side/*
 p, admin-darkside:role, database-clusters, *, the-dark-side/*
 p, admin-darkside:role, database-clusters-credentials, read, the-dark-side/*
 p, admin-darkside:role, backup-storages, *, the-dark-side/*
 p, admin-darkside:role, monitoring-instances, *, the-dark-side/*
```

Explanation:

The `admin-darkside` role has the following privileges:

- The `admin-darkside` role can only view `the-dark-side` namespace.
- The `admin-darkside' role can view and update the database engines in only `the-dark-side` namespace
- The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the database clusters in only `the-dark-side` namespace
- The `admin-darkside` role can view the database clusters only in `the-dark-side` namespace.
- The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the backup storages in only `the-dark-side` namespace
- The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the monitoring instances in only `the-dark-side` namespace


|** Namespace`the-dark-side`**|
|----------------------------|
| -The `admin-darkside` role can only view `the-dark-side` namespace.|
| -The `admin-darkside' role can view and update the database engines in only `the-dark-side` namespace.|
|-The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the database clusters in only `the-dark-side` namespace.|
|- The `admin-darkside` role can view the database clusters only in `the-dark-side` namespace.|
|- The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the backup storages in only `the-dark-side` namespace.|
|- The `admin-darkside` role can view, create, update, and delete the monitoring instances in only `the-dark-side` namespace.|


The `admin-darkside` role has the following privileges:

|**Resource**| **Read**| **Create**| **Update**|**Delete**|
|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Namespace:`the-dark-side`|This role can only view `the-dark-side` namespace| :x:|:x:| :x:|
|Database engines|This role can view the datbase engines only in the`the-dark-side` namespace.|:x:|This role can update the database engines only in the`the-dark-side`namespace| :x:|




## RBAC resources and privileges

Below is a comprehensive table outlining the permissions granted for various **resources**:

??? info "Permissions for resources"


    !!! info "Important"
        If you have permission for specific namespaces or resources, you can perform read, update, create, or delete actions only on those resources or only within those namespaces. However, if you have permission for **all** the resources or namespaces, you can carry out these actions across all the resources and namespaces.
