# Role Based Access Control



Role-based access control (RBAC) is widely used to regulate access to resources within an organization. It establishes a framework that defines access permissions and privileges based on the roles of individual users. RBAC ensures that only authorized individuals can access specific information or perform certain actions based on their assigned roles. This approach enhances security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and helps manage permissions more efficiently across the organization.
