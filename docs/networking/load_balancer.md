# Load balancer configuration in Percona Everest

## Overview

Provisioning external access to Kubernetes clusters can be challenging, since cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure each have their own annotations and configurations for load balancers. As a result, users often have to manually adjust settings for each environment, leading to a lack of a unified approach.

## Why use load balancer?

Percona Everest simplifies the process by enabling administrators to define reusable load balancer configurations. This includes cloud provider-specific settings that can be applied consistently across clusters, ensuring:

- Consistency across cloud and on-prem environments

- Reduced manual effort when provisioning external access

- Flexibility to support multiple cloud providers with a unified approach
