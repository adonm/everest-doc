# Load balancer use cases


## Create load balancer configs

Percona Everest administrators create load balancer configurations suitable for their infrastructure in advance, allowing all Percona Everest users to utilize them later without having to define rules for each database cluster creation.

**Key characteristics:**

-  Load balancer config has a globally unique name across the entire Percona Everest deployment.

- It can be applied to the Proxy component of any supported database Engine.

- It is not associated with a specific namespace, so the same configuration to be applied across all namespaces managed by Percona Everest.

- It consists of a set of key-value pairs representing annotations that need to be applied to the appropriate load balancer.


After all required values are configured, the Percona Everest administrator saves the configuration to make it available for use throughout the platform.


## Restrict access to load balancer configs with Role-based access control (RBAC) policies

The Percona Everest administrator can limit access to specific load balancer configs, including the ability to apply or modify them. This is achieved using Percona Everestâ€™s RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system.

**Key characteristics:**

- RBAC policies apply to the entire load balancer configuration, including all key-value pairs in the template.

- It is not possible to assign access control to individual key-value pairs within a specific load balancer configuration.

### Restrict usage of load balancer configs

The Percona Everest administrator can manage (**create/edit/read/delete**) load balancer config for specific Percona Everest users only. The rest of the users can only **read** load balancer config content and can apply existing configs when provisioning database clusters, but cannot modify them.

To achieve this, the following RBAC policy is defined:

```sh
p, alice, load-balancer-configs, *, *
p, role:team-dev, load-balancer-configs, read, *

```
