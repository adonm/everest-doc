# Troubleshooting issues

This section is your go-to resource for tackling common issues and finding solutions. For additional troubleshooting tips and known issues, see the Percona Everest [Release Notes](../release-notes/release_notes_index.md) and [known limitations](../reference/known_limitations.md) section.


## General troubleshooting guidelines

Before troubleshooting, it's important to understand how Percona Everest works at a high level. Understanding how it works can help narrow down potential areas to investigate.

- Refer to the [kubectl quick reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/){:target="_blank"} for some useful commands.

- Logs and events are your main sources of information when troubleshooting.



### Important logs and commands

Depending on the specific issue, you can review different logs for additional information.

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f <pod-name of database or proxy> -c <database-container>
    ```

5. **Kubernetes Events**

    !!! info "Important"
        Events (Events are stored only for 60 mins, if there are any events which are older than 60 mins, it will be lost).

    ```sh
    kubectl get events --sort-by=".lastTimestamp"
    ```

## Troubleshooting key areas

### Installation issues

For troubleshooting Percona Everest installation issues using **everestctl** or the **Helm chart**, the following steps may be helpful:
{.power-number}

1. Appropriate privileges may be required depending on the selected components for installation. For instance, if OLM is to be installed, `cluster-admin` privileges are required. If any of the components fail, verify that the appropriate privileges are granted.

    Run the following command to check if the required privileges are granted:

    ```sh
    kubectl auth can-i
    ```

2. Verify the installation status of the Helm chart. A properly functioning chart should be in a **Deployed** status. 

    To verify the values used during the chart installation, run the following command:

    ```sh
    helm list -n everest-system
    NAME  NAMESPACE   REVISION  UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART        	APP VERSION
    everest-core everest-system	1  2025-01-16 16:24:56.577713 +0530 
    IST	deployed	everest-1.4.0	1.4.0
    ```

3. As there are many components in the Percona Everest installation, installation will fail if any of the **subcomponent installations fail**. Check the relevant namespace where components are installed, along with the logs and events.

    For instance, a job is created to approve the installation plan for operators. If there are no resources left in the cluster to run pods, the Helm installation will continue waiting for the specified ``--timeout`` or the default of 5 minutes before failing.

### API, Authentication, and frontend issues

To troubleshoot issues with the Percona Everest API, authentication, or frontend, check the everest-server deployment. 
{.power-number}

1. If the Percona Everest API is not working, check the status of the everest-server pod, specifically its **Status** and **Restarts**.

    ```sh
    kubectl get po -l app.kubernetes.io/name=everest-server -n everest-system

    NAME                            READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
    everest-server-78699679d4-kgqk5 1/1   Running  0       4d23h
    ```

2. Check the `everest-server` logs. 

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f deploy/everest-server -n everest-system
    ```

3. To resolve authentication and access issues, check the Percona Everest server logs. If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../administer/rbac.md) is implemented, [validate](../administer/administer/rbac.md#validate-your-rbac-policy) or [check the permissions](../administer/rbac.md#test-your-rbac-policy) using `everestctl`.

    ```sh
    kubectl get configmap everest-rbac -n everest-system
    ```

4. Check the `everest-operator` logs for any reconciliation errors.

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f deploy/everest-operator -n everest-system
    ```

5. If you experience any access issues or lag in the Percona Everest frontend or API, try port-forwarding to the service and check the latency compared to accessing it via a LoadBalancer or NodePort. Once you have set up the port-forward, access the webpage using `localhost:8080`.


    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward svc/everest 8080:8080
    ```

### Database operation issues

Here are the common issues related to the database operations:
{.power-number}

1. Check the `everest-operator` logs if the `DatabaseCluster` object has not been created or if there are any issues with it. 

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f deploy/everest-operator -n everest-system
    ```

2. Check the `DatabaseCluster` object, verify its status and events. The status should be **Ready**. If it is anything other than **Ready**, further investigation is required. Describing the `DatabaseCluster` object provides details about the database configuration.

    ```sh
    kubectl get DatabaseCluster <DatabaseCluster-Name>
    kubectl describe DatabaseCluster <DatabaseCluster-Name>
    kubectl get DatabaseCluster <DatabaseCluster-Name> -oyaml
    ```


3. Check the relevant database objects such as PXC, PSMDB, and PG, as well as the operator logs. For instance, check the PXC object followed by the operator logs.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pxc <database-name>
    kubectl describe pxc <database-name>
    kubectl get pxc <database-name> -oyaml 
    kubectl logs -f deploy/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator
    
    # Change to pxc,psmdb,pg for respective database
    ```

4. Check the database pod logs:

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f <database-pod-name> -c <database-container-name>  
    
    # (container name could be database,pxc,mongo)
    ```
