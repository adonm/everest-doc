# ðŸŽ‰ First release of Percona Everest!

We are excited to announce the first internal release of Percona Everest, our latest addition to Perconaâ€™s suite of solutions.

With Everest, we're changing the way businesses manage their databases with a powerful open source database-as-a-service (DBaaS) solution.

## Ready to test drive Percona Everest?

How about installing a demo environment to check Percona Everest in action?

## Before you start

First, ensure that you have a publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster.

We recommend setting one up on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), as it may be difficult to currently spin one up on local Kubernetes installations (minikube, kind, k3d, or similar products).

Percona Everest assists with installing all the necessary Operators and required packages, but does not currently help with spinning up a Kubernetes cluster.

Percona Everest has two primary components:

- The [CLI](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-cli), which connects Percona Everest to your Kubernetes cluster.

- Everest application (Ui for simplicity) that you can spin up with our quickstart instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with Percona Everest, we recommend you:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and docker-compose

- Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

- Install make

- kubeconfig (Everest will use default one from ~/.kube/config)

### Get started

To install and provision Percona Everest:

1. Use the following commands to spin up the backend and frontend:

    ```
    azwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-everest-backend/v0.1.0/quickstart.yml
    ```

    ```
    docker-compose -f quickstart.yml up -d
    ```

2. Download the latest release of the [everestctl](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-cli/releases) command to provision Percona Everest.

3. Rename the downloaded file as follows:

    ```
    mv everestctl-darwin-amd64 everestctl
    ```

4. Modify the file permissions:

    ```
    chmod +x everestctl
    ```

5. Get a kubeconfig file and rename it to config.yaml. You can skip this step if you have your kubeconfig file in ./kube/config/.

6. Run the following command to install all required operators in headless mode:

    ```
    ./everestctl install operators --backup.enable=false --everest.endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8080 --monitoring.enable=false --operator.mongodb=true --operator.postgresql=true --operator.xtradb-cluster=true --skip-wizard -k 
    config.yaml
    ```

    Note! Make sure to run the above command from the directory where config.yaml is located.

    Alternatively, use the installation wizard:

    <pre><code>
    âœ— ./everestctl install operators
    ? Everest URL http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ? Choose your Kubernetes Cluster name k3d-everest-dev
    ? Do you want to enable monitoring? No
    ? Do you want to enable backups? No
    ? What operators do you want to install? MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL </pre></code>

7. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to create your first database cluster.

We welcome you to play and poke around, check out our [backend documentation](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-backend/blob/90aec1b8c5686fc18d7f63202c2f41d9cb53a4f8/README.md), and ask any questions you have about Percona Everest before we go live with our first Beta at the end of September.

Important! To enhance the quality of our product and better understand all needs, we have created this [quick form](https://www.notion.so/percona/d67b6dd6afa04a149ab8685c609dbda8?v=ee3ab0c7c4d5490aa57552eb506da3bb) to capture your feedback. 

## Whatâ€™s not in yet?

This internal release has the following limitations:


- Backups show as **Disabled**. Next release, they can be enabled via **Create Database** wizard.

- Database resources are hard-coded limits for now. Next release, real limits will be used on the **Resources** page of the **Create Database** wizard.

- IP addresses/ranges: only one via UI. Multiple to come next release. 

- Limited database cluster parameters customization via UI (Resources and External Access).

- Monitoring is now disabled. In the next release we can enable it in the settings and use it via **Create Database** wizard.

Weâ€™re also aiming to add before public beta release: 

- Documentation on how to deploy EKS and GKE k8s cluster

- Single command deploy/installation process


Happy exploring!
