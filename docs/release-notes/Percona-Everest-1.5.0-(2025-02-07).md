# What's new in Percona Everest 1.5.0

!!! warning
    Google Container Registry (GCR) is scheduled to be deprecated and will officially shut down on March 18, 2025. All versions of Percona Everest prior to 1.4.0 depend on images hosted on GCR, meaning that downloading those images will fail after the shutdown date. We strongly recommend upgrading to Percona Everest version 1.4.0 as soon as possible. If you do not upgrade, Percona Everest will no longer function.

    For more details, refer to the [Container Registry Deprecation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/prepare-gcr-shutdown){:target="_blank"}.

## Known limitations

- In Percona Operator for PostgreSQL version 2.5.0, backups start failing after a minor version upgrade from PostgreSQL 16.3 to 16.4 if **monitoring is enabled** on the database. 

    **Workaround** 

    Once you upgrade your PostgreSQL version, itâ€™s essential to also update the `pg_stat_monitor` extension by executing the following command:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor UPDATE;
    ```

- The backup storage you choose for your initial backup schedule will be used for all subsequent schedules and point-in-time recovery (PITR).

- When creating a 1-node MongoDB cluster, the cluster temporarily enters an **Error** state instead of **Initializing** before transitioning to the **Ready** state.

- When restoring a MySQL database from a backup, the process may fail if the database name is too long. Use a shorter name for the restored database.
