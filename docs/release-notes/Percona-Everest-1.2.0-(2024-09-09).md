## Release highlights


### Introducing RBAC in Percona Everest: Ensure security and simplify database access management

Starting with Percona Everest 1.2.0, weâ€™ve enhanced our platform by introducing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which regulates resource access for better management and security.

With RBAC, only authorized individuals can access specific resources or perform certain actions based on their assigned roles. This method improves security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and helps manage permissions more efficiently across Percona Everest.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts in RBAC:

- [Roles](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/rbac.html#default-role) - Roles are a set of permissions that allow users to access and carry out various tasks within Percona Everest.

- [RBAC resources and privileges](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/rbac.html#rbac-resources-and-privileges): Resources are the entities or objects within Percona Everest that require controlled access. Privileges specify the particular actions that a role is able to perform on a resource.

- [Policy definition](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/rbac.html#policy-definition-in-rbac): RBAC policies are the rules and guidelines that define how roles, permissions, and users are managed within RBAC.


    The policy definition in Percona Everest is:

        ```sh
        p, <subject>, <resource-type>, <action>, <resource-name>
        ```

- [Role assignment](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/rbac.html#assigning-roles-to-users): Assigning specific roles to individual users within Percona Everest is crucial for the roles to be effective.

    The syntax for assigning a role is as follows:

    ```sh
    g, username, rolename
    ```

Explore our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/administer/rbac.html) for everything you need to know about RBAC.


#### Percona Everest v1.2.0: A deep dive into Breaking API changes

Beginning with Percona Everest v1.2.0, breaking changes are being introduced to the API for `monitoring-instances` and `backup-storages` resources. These updates include:

- Before the release of Percona Everest 1.2.0, the resources `monitoring-instances` and  `backup-storages` had a global scope. Earlier, Percona Everest used a `.spec.allowedNamespaces` field to control access to these global resources. This field defined the namespaces where the resources could be accessed, thus providing some degree of access control.

- With the upgrade to Percona Everest version 1.2.0, the transition from global scope to the designated namespaces for these resources is an important change in the way access control is managed. This improves security as the resources are only accessible within their designated namespaces. The database clusters can only use `monitoring-instances` and `backup-storages` located within the same namespace as the cluster.

- When upgrading to 1.2.0 using the CLI command `everestctl upgrade`, all your existing `backup-storages` and `monitoring-instances` will be automatically migrated to the namespaces specified in their `.spec.allowedNamespaces` fields.

    !!! note
        After the upgrade to Percona Everest 1.2.0, you will only be able to access these resources through the new API endpoints.

    Check out our [documentation](docs.percona.com/everest//administer/api_rbac.html#changes-in-the-percona-everest-apis) for in-depth details on the Breaking API changes.


### Exploring the benefits of MongoDB sharding in Percona Everest

[Sharding  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-sharding) is used for horizontal database scaling. It distributes a database horizontally across multiple nodes or servers, known as **shards**. Each shard manages a portion of the data, forming a sharded cluster, which enables MongoDB to handle large datasets and high user concurrency effectively.

MongoDB sharding has several key components:

- shard: Each shard has a subset of the data.
- mongos: The query router directs the client queries to the proper shard(s).

    !!! note
        With the current Percona Everest release, the number of routers (mongos) is, by default, set to the number of nodes in your replica set. However, in our upcoming releases, you can customize the number of routers and set resource limits for them.

- config servers: The configuration servers store the cluster's metadata and configuration settings.

#### Enable sharding in Percona Everest

To enable sharding:
{.power-number}

1. On the **Create Database **wizard, select **MongoDB** database and turn on the Sharded Cluster toggle.

2. To check if sharding is enabled, go to the database view page and click on the specific database. Then, check the **Resources** panel to see if sharding is enabled.

### Improved mulitple operator upgrades


Starting with Percona Everest 1.2.0, we have the capability to upgrade all the database operators concurrently with their components across any namespace using our intuitive UI with just a single click.

Before initiating the upgrade process, Everest provides a comprehensive list of tasks that must be completed to ensure a seamless transition of your clusters to the next version of the database operators.
