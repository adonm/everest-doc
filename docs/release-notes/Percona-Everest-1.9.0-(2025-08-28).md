## üåü Release highlights

### üåê Load Balancer configuration in Percona Everest


## New features


- [EVEREST-548](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-548): Starting with Percona Everest 1.9.0, we have added support for managing `LoadBalancerConfigs`, which simplifies how service annotations are applied to database clusters.

## Improvements

- [EVEREST-2002](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2002): Percona Everest now includes a pre-check mechanism to validate the compatibility of **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** before upgrading. This enhancement helps prevent upgrade failures due to CRD mismatches, ensuring a smoother upgrade process.

- [EVEREST-2101](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2101): The behavior of the **Add New** button in the **External Access** section has been improved. Now, you can only add a new field after filling in the previously created field with a value.

    This enhancement ensures users complete the required information before adding more entries, reducing unnecessary blank fields and improving the overall user experience.

- [EVEREST-2114](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2114): The search and filter options now always remain visible on the left side, ensuring a consistent layout and easier navigation.

- [EVEREST-2165](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/EVEREST-2165): We have added a s**how password** toggle in the **PMM monitoring endpoint** form. This feature helps us verify if we have entered the correct password.
