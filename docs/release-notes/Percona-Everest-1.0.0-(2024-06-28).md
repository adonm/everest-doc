# What's new in Percona Everest 1.0.0

To begin your journey with Percona Everest, check out the [Quickstart Guide for Percona Everest](../quickstart-guide/quick-install.md).

Percona Everest is an open source cloud native database platform that helps provision and manage databases faster, scale deployments rapidly, and reduce database administration overhead. Plus, you can regain control over your data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs.

Version 1.0.0 introduces the following changes:


## Release highlights

## Simplified database operator upgrades

We are excited to announce that you can now upgrade database operators and all their components across any namespace with just a single click using our intuitive UI.

Morever, before initiating the upgrade process, Everest provides a comprehensive list of tasks that must be completed to ensure a seamless transition of your clusters to the next version of the database operators.

For deep dive into this feature, see our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/upgrade/upgrade_operators.html).



## User management

Percona Everest 1.0.0 introduces user management features, enabling you to securely log in to the platform through either the Percona Everest user interface or the API. So, get ready for a more secure and user-friendly experience with this update.
		
Local user management involves administering Percona Everest users to ensure secure access to database resources. This encompasses tasks such as creating and deleting users, updating their passwords, etc.

If youâ€™re looking for in-depth insights into this feature, see our [documentation]() 


## IdP integration for enhanced security

Starting with Percona Everest 1.0.0, you can now integrate your Percona Everest instance using an external identity provider (IdP). This enables centralized authentication and authorization management, streamlining and simplifying user access. By tapping into IdP integration, you can ensure that users are authenticated and authorized securely.

Percona Everest uses [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol){:target="_blank"} (OIDC) Protocol to integrate with external Identity Providers (IdP).

To integrate IdP with Percona Everest, first, [install Percona Everest](../install/installEverest.md) and then [configure OIDC](../secure/IdP_integration#configure-oidc-on-the-providerss-side) on the IdP's side as well as the [Percona Everest side](../secure/IdP_integration#configure-oidc-on-percona-everest-side).

To explore the depths of this feature, delve into our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/secure/IdP_integratiopn.html).
