## Secure access through user authentication


We have taken a significant step towards ensuring the security of Percona Everest by introducing user authentication in our latest release. This feature is designed to restrict access to the databases hosted on Percona Everest, thereby safeguarding any sensitive information stored within them. With user authentication in place, only authorized users will be able to access the databases.

If youâ€™re looking to dive deep into this feature, see our comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/secure/user-auth.html).
