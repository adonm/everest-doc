## üåü Release highlights

=== ":material-database-import: Seamlessly import external backups into Percona Everest clusters"

Starting with Percona Everest 1.8.0, we are excited to roll out a new feature that enables you to directly import database backups from external object storage into clusters managed by Percona Everest. This feature leverages an extensible framework that simplifies your backup process.

=== " :simple-mongodb: MongoDB"
    
    ### Support for PSMDB operator v1.20.1

    Percona Everest 1.8.0 now includes support for PSMDB operator version 1.20.1.



### OIDC Integration with Microsoft Entra ID

If you are using Microsoft Entra ID as your OIDC provider for Percona Everest, please be aware of a breaking change in the way access tokens are validated. 

The access tokens issued by Microsoft Entra ID must now include the `aud` claim with the value set to the correct application identifier. This can be achieved by requesting the `<your-app-client-id>/.default` scope when obtaining the access token.
Please ensure you configure Everest's OIDC settings requesting the correct scope to avoid any disruptions in your authentication flow:

```sh
everestctl settings oidc configure \
--issuer-url=http://url.com \
--client-id=<your-app-client-id> \
--scopes=openid,profile,email,<your-app-client-id>/.default
```

üìò For detailed information, see our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/reference/known_limitations.html#oidc-integration-with-microsoft-entra).
