## üåü Release highlights

=== ":material-database-import: Import external backups into Percona Everest clusters"

    !!! warning
        The external backup import feature in Percona Everest is currently in **Technical Preview**. Early adopters are advised to use this feature only for testing purposes and **not in production environments**.

    Starting with Percona Everest 1.8.0, we are excited to roll out a new feature that enables you to directly import database backups from external object storage into clusters managed by Percona Everest. This feature leverages an extensible framework that simplifies your backup process.

    ### Objectives
    This feature can help you achieve the following objectives:

    - Import backup data from external storage such as Amazon S3 directly into Percona Everest-managed database clusters.

    - Support a wide range of backup formats and tools, including both logical and physical backups created using `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, `mongodump`, and more.

    - Provide a pluggable and extensible framework that can adapt to different import needs and workflows.

    ### How to import external database backups using the Percona Everest UI

    Here are the steps to import the external backups:
    {.power-number}

    1. From the Percona Everest homepage, click **Import**. Select the database type you want to import(MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB). The **Basic information** page will be displayed.

    2. Fill in the details on the **Basic information** page and click **Continue**. This will take you to the **Import information** page.

    3. On the Import Information page, enter the following:

        - Choose the data importer from the dropdown on the **Import information** page.

        - Provide S3 details.

        -  Specify the **File Directory** path within your S3 bucket where the backup files are stored. Click **Save**.

        -  Enter the key-value pairs and user secrets (For MongoDB and MySQL) in the **DB credentials** section.

    4. Enter the information and click **Continue** until you reach the end of the wizard. Your backup import process will now start. You will be notified once the import is successfully completed.
