    Google Container Registry (GCR) is scheduled to be deprecated and will officially shut down on March 18, 2025. All versions of Percona Everest prior to 1.4.0 depend on images hosted on GCR, meaning that downloading those images will fail after the shutdown date. We strongly recommend upgrading to Percona Everest version 1.4.0 as soon as possible. If you do not upgrade, Percona Everest will no longer function.
