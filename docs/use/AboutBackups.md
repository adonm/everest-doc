# About backups

## Why itâ€™s important to create backups

Databases (DBs) may get damaged due to a variety of reasons, including disk crashes, power outages, software errors, or even virus attacks.  

To ensure that you can recover data in such events, it is critical to back up your databases. With Everest, you can do this with zero downtime and minimal performance impact.

## Supported setups

Everest enables you to create and restore on-demand and scheduled backups. Future releases will also add Point-in-Time-Recovery functionality.
