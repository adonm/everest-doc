## Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

PITR restores databases up to a specific moment in time. This involves retrieving data from a backup snapshot and replaying all subsequent events that occurred until a specified moment using oplog slices.

PITR serves as a safeguard against data loss during various disasters, including database crashes, accidental data deletions, table drops, or unintended updates to multiple fields instead of a single one.
