# Manual storage scaling

You can increase the capacity of your S3-compatible storage through manual storage scaling. This is done by either adjusting existing resources or allocating new ones. This feature gives you precise control over your storage to accommodate increasing data demands.

While you can adjust CPU and memory allocations for your databases, the disk size is fixed after the initial database provisioning. This enhancement allows you to manage expanding database workloads effectively while maintaining system stability and robust data security.
