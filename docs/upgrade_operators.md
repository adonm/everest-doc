## Upgrade database operators

Starting with Percona Everest 1.0.0, the intuitive UI allows you to upgrade database operators and all their components with a single click.

## Before you upgrade


Before upgrading a database operator, Everest presents a list of tasks that need to be completed to smoothly transition your clusters to the next version of the database operators. These tasks may include:

- Upgrading your database engine version from an unsupported or end-of-life (EOL) version.

- Ensuring your clusters are using a supported [Custom Resource](https://ibm.github.io/kubernetes-operators/lab1/#:~:text=A%20CRD%20defines%20Custom%20Resources,store%20and%20retrieve%20structured%20data.) (CR) version.
