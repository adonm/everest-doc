# Helm Chart


## Helm Chart overview

[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. A Helm chart is a bundle of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Helm makes it easy to define, install, and manage complex Kubernetes applications.

### Why use Helm Chart?

Helm chart packages all the Kubernetes manifests (deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, RBAC resources, etc.) required by Percona Everest. Instead of manually writing and managing these resources, you can use a single Helm command to deploy the entire setup.
